### Dashboard
The dashboard shows that over 81 % of users are subscribers and 19% are customers. Based on this information, one can conclude that the bike sharing business is supported by the people living in the city of New York. The gender breakdown is represented by approximately 1.5M males, 500k females and 225k of unknown gender.
The bar graph shows that for the month of August the user peak hour is from 7am to 9am and 4pm to 7pm, these peak hours show a relationship with the user type subscribers. The peak hours coincide with the time that people are going to and coming from work. One interesting fact that can be seen in the Trip count by birth year is that the users that use the service most are the ones born between 1985 and 1995 for all genders:
Male average trip count – 60.2k
Female average trip count – 27.6k
Unknown average trip count – 814
